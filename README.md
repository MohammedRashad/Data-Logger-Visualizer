# Data-Logger-Visualizer
Visualize and log DHT11/DHT22 data using PIC Microcontroller &amp; Matlab


# Introduction 

DHT11 & DHT22 are famous sensors among hobbyists and amateurs for their cheapness and precesion, they are used to measure both temprature and humiditiy to a great precesion compared to their prices. 

This embedded application is used to record the data in real time using these sensors and then visualize it using matlab.
